Test
====

A test to experiment and learn my first time around GitHub.
I am also learning how to edit and update text's like this through GitBash.
Learned something that could have saved me a lot of fustration...
the dark grey folders over "src" represent that it has been compressed.
No wonder I couldn't open it.
